## Work in Progress
- Continue working on the task to calculate which % of IT helpdesk requests can be handled by our proposed solution.
- We developed the end-to-end pipeline with the following components and tested on 1000 example data
    - Keywords extraction using WatsonX models
        - IT helpdesk requests
        - knowledgebase resources
    - Question Generation using WatsonX 
        - generate questions that the knowledgebase could answer for
    - Similarity Analysis
        - Leveraged [spacy](https://spacy.io/) packages to tokenize keywords and calculate the cosine similarity score between each IT helpdesk requests and all knowledgebase keywords
## Currently Tracking
- The team is working on pushing solution documentation to GitHub.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to work through the use cases and scale the usecase
