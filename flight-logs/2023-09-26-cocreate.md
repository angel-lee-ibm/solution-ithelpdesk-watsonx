## Work in Progress
- Client shared sample data to the team and asked if we could estimate which % of IT helpdesk requests can be handled by our proposed solution.
- We plan to develop the end-to-end pipeline using a sample of datasets.
    - apply watsonx models to extract keywords from IT helpdesk requests.
    - apply watsonx models to extract keywords from knowledgebase resources.
    - apply watsonx models to generate questions that the knowledgebase could answer for.
    - apply similarity analysis between each IT helpdesk requests keywords to the complete corpus of knowledge-base keywords and calculated the cosine similarity score between each incident and all knowledgebase keywords

## Currently Tracking
- The team is working on pushing solution documentation to GitHub.

## Next Steps
- The team will continue to work through the use cases and scale afterwards
